### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Current Situation**:
   - **Weather**: Clear
   - **Lighting**: Daytime
   - **Road Type**: Commercial area road
   - **Static Obstacles**: Parked vehicles on the roadside
   - **Ego Vehicle State**: 
     - Position: (423.72, 1656.21)
     - Speed: 5.00 m/s
     - Acceleration: 0.38 m/s²
     - Direction: 0.00 radians
   - **Surrounding Vehicles**:
     - Preceding vehicle at a relative position of (-0.24, 61.98) with a relative speed of 0.07 m/s and relative acceleration of 0.00 m/s²

2. **Evaluate the Prediction Horizon (N)**:
   - Given the current speed (5.00 m/s) and the clear weather conditions, a prediction horizon of 10 time steps is reasonable to ensure smooth and safe navigation.

3. **Set Cost Weights**:
   - **Q (speed maintenance weight)**: Fixed at 1.
   - **R (control effort weight)**: Given the clear weather and commercial area, a moderate value of 1.93 is appropriate to balance control effort and responsiveness.
   - **Q_h (headway maintenance weight)**: Considering the need to maintain a safe distance in a commercial area with parked vehicles, a value of 3.11 is suitable.

4. **Define Desired Speed**:
   - The target speed should be safe and efficient. Given the clear weather and daytime conditions, a desired speed of 6.21 m/s is appropriate.

5. **Determine Desired Headway**:
   - To ensure a safe distance from the preceding vehicle, especially in a commercial area with potential pedestrian activity, a desired headway of 2.6 seconds is appropriate.

### Optimized MPC Parameters:

1. **Prediction Horizon (N)**: 10
2. **Cost Weights**:
   - **Q (speed maintenance weight)**: 1
   - **R (control effort weight)**: 1.93
   - **Q_h (headway maintenance weight)**: 3.11
3. **desired_speed**: 6.21 m/s
4. **desired_headway**: 2.6 seconds

These parameters should provide a balance between maintaining a safe distance from the preceding vehicle, ensuring smooth control efforts, and achieving an efficient speed for the given road conditions.
Sure, here are the optimized MPC parameters in the requested list format:

\[10, 1, 1.93, 3.11, 6.21, 2.6\]
