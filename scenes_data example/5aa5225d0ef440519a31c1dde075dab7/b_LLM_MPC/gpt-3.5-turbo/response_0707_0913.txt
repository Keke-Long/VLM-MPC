Based on the current situation and step-by-step reasoning provided, let's generate the optimal MPC parameters:

1. **Prediction Horizon (N):** Since the ego vehicle is moving at a moderate speed of 5 m/s in a commercial area with parked vehicles, a prediction horizon of 10 time steps seems reasonable to anticipate potential obstacles and make informed decisions.

2. **Cost Weights:**
   - **Q (speed maintenance weight):** Fixed at 1.
   - **R (control effort weight):** Given the presence of parked vehicles and the need for smooth control, a slightly higher weight of 2.0 is chosen to prioritize minimizing control effort.
   - **Q_h (headway maintenance weight):** Considering the importance of maintaining a safe headway, a weight of 3.0 is selected to ensure the ego vehicle maintains a suitable distance from the preceding vehicle.

3. **Desired Speed:** The historical average desired speed is 6.21 m/s, but considering the current scenario and the need for caution due to parked vehicles, a slightly lower target speed of 6 m/s is chosen for safety.

4. **Desired Headway:** The desired headway is set to 2.6 seconds based on historical data. Considering the relative speed and acceleration of the preceding vehicle, this headway allows for a safe following distance.

Therefore, the optimal MPC parameters are as follows:

[MPC Parameters: [N=10, Q=1, R=2.0, Q_h=3.0, desired_speed=6.0 m/s, desired_headway=2.6 s]]
The optimal MPC parameters in the requested list format are:

[MPC Parameters: [10, 1, 2.0, 3.0, 6.0, 2.6]]
