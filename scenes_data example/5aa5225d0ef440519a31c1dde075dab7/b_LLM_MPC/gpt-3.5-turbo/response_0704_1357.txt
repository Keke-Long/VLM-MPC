Based on the current situation and step-by-step reasoning, let's generate the optimal MPC parameters:

1. **Prediction Horizon (N):** Since the ego vehicle is moving at a moderate speed in a commercial area with parked vehicles, a prediction horizon of 10 time steps seems reasonable to anticipate potential obstacles and make timely adjustments.

2. **Cost Weights:**
   - **Q (speed maintenance weight):** Fixed at 1.
   - **R (control effort weight):** Given the presence of parked vehicles and the need for smooth control, a slightly higher weight on control effort is beneficial. Let's set R = 1.5.
   - **Q_h (headway maintenance weight):** Maintaining a safe headway is crucial, especially in a commercial area with static obstacles. Let's set Q_h = 2.

3. **Desired Speed:** Considering the current speed of 5 m/s and the need for safe maneuvering in the commercial area, let's set the desired_speed to 7 m/s.

4. **Desired Headway:** The desired headway should be sufficient to react to any sudden changes in the preceding vehicle's behavior. Considering the relative speed and acceleration of the front vehicle, let's set the desired_headway to 2 seconds.

Therefore, the optimal MPC parameters are:
[N, Q, R, Q_h, desired_speed, desired_headway] = [10, 1, 1.5, 2, 7, 2]
The optimal MPC parameters in the requested list format are: 
[10, 1, 1.5, 2, 7, 2]
