### Step 1: Current Situation Analysis

- **Weather:** Clear
- **Lighting:** Daytime
- **Road Type:** Road
- **Static Obstacles:** Parked vehicles on the roadside
- **Ego Vehicle State:**
  - Position: [(423.72, 1656.21), (424.82, 1658.46), (425.86, 1660.64), (426.87, 1662.85), (427.78, 1664.85)]
  - Speed: [5.00, 4.82, 4.88, 4.39, 3.95]
  - Acceleration: [0.38, 0.17, 0.98, 0.87, 0.60]
- **Surrounding Vehicles State:**
  - Preceding Vehicle:
    - Relative Position: (-1.35, 39.89)
    - Relative Speed: 0.07
    - Relative Acceleration: 0.00

### Step 2: Evaluate Prediction Horizon (N)

Given that the preferred value for the Prediction Horizon is 10, we will use N = 10.

### Step 3: Set Cost Weights

- **Q (speed maintenance weight):** Fixed at 1.
- **R (control effort weight):** Weight for minimizing control effort. Average value: 1.93
- **Q_h (headway maintenance weight):** Weight for maintaining the desired headway. Average value: 3.11

### Step 4: Define Desired Speed

- **Desired Speed (desired_speed):** Target speed for the ego vehicle. Range: 5 to 11 m/s. Average value: 6.21 m/s

### Step 5: Determine Desired Headway

- **Desired Headway (desired_headway):** Desired headway between the ego vehicle and the front vehicle. Average value: 2.6 seconds

### Final MPC Parameters:
- **Prediction Horizon (N):** 10
- **Cost Weights:**
  - Q (speed maintenance weight): 1
  - R (control effort weight): 1.93
  - Q_h (headway maintenance weight): 3.11
- **Desired Speed (desired_speed):** 6.21 m/s
- **Desired Headway (desired_headway):** 2.6 seconds

These optimized MPC parameters will help in controlling the ego vehicle efficiently and safely in the current driving scenario.
The MPC parameters in the requested list format are as follows:
- [10, 1, 1.93, 3.11, 6.21, 2.6]
