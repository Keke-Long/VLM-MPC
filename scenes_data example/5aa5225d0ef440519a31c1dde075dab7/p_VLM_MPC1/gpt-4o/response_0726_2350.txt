It seems like you're trying to describe the current environment, specifically the weather and lighting conditions. Based on your input, it appears that:

* The weather is clear, indicating a sunny or cloudless day.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can help with!
Based on the provided information, here is my reasoning for generating the MPC parameters:

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Understand the Current Situation**: The weather is clear, and there are parked vehicles on the roadside. The ego vehicle is traveling at a speed of 5 m/s with an acceleration of 0.38 m/s².
2. **Evaluate the Prediction Horizon (N)**: Considering the current speed and environment, I recommend a prediction horizon of N = 10, which allows for some flexibility in adjusting to changes on the road while still maintaining a safe distance from the preceding vehicle.
3. **Set Cost Weights**:
	* **Q** is fixed at 1 to simplify the optimization process.
	* Balance **R** (control effort weight) and **Q_h** (headway maintenance weight) relative to Q, considering safety and comfort. I suggest setting R = 2 and Q_h = 3.11, which prioritizes maintaining a safe distance from the preceding vehicle while still allowing for some control effort.
4. **Define Desired Speed**: Choose a target speed that is safe and efficient for the current conditions. Considering the clear weather and moderate acceleration, I recommend a desired speed of 6 m/s, which is slightly higher than the current speed but still allows for some flexibility in adjusting to changes on the road.
5. **Determine Desired Headway**: Ensure a safe distance to the preceding vehicle, taking into account the current relative speed and acceleration. Considering the relative speed of 0.07 m/s and acceleration of 0.00 m/s², I recommend a desired headway of 2.4 seconds, which provides a comfortable distance while still allowing for some flexibility in adjusting to changes on the road.

**Optimal MPC Parameters:**

[N, Q, R, Q_h, desired_speed, desired_headway]
[10, 1, 2, 3.11, 6, 2.4]

Please note that these parameters are based on my reasoning and may need to be updated in the next 20 seconds with updated scene information.
