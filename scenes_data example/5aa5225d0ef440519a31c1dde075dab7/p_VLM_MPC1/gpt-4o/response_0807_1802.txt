### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Current Situation:**
   - **Weather:** Clear
   - **Lighting:** Daytime
   - **Road Type:** Road with parked vehicles on the roadside
   - **Ego Vehicle State:** The vehicle is decelerating slightly.
   - **Surrounding Vehicles:** One preceding vehicle detected, moving at a similar speed.

2. **Evaluate the Prediction Horizon (N):**
   - The preferred value is 10, which is reasonable for the current scenario to ensure the vehicle can plan adequately ahead.

3. **Set Cost Weights:**
   - **Q (speed maintenance weight):** Fixed at 1.
   - **R (control effort weight):** Needs to balance smooth driving and responsiveness. Given the current scenario with parked vehicles and a preceding vehicle, a moderate value is appropriate.
   - **Q_h (headway maintenance weight):** Needs to ensure a safe distance from the preceding vehicle. Given the relative position and speed, a slightly higher value than average might be beneficial to maintain safety.

4. **Define Desired Speed:**
   - The historical average desired speed is 6.21 m/s. Given the current speed trend and the presence of a preceding vehicle, a slightly lower desired speed might be safer and more efficient.

5. **Determine Desired Headway:**
   - The historical average desired headway is 2.6 seconds. Given the current scenario, maintaining this headway is appropriate to ensure safety.

### Optimized MPC Parameters:

1. **Prediction Horizon (N):** 10
2. **Cost Weights:**
   - **Q (speed maintenance weight):** 1 (fixed)
   - **R (control effort weight):** 2.0 (slightly higher to ensure smooth control)
   - **Q_h (headway maintenance weight):** 3.5 (slightly higher to ensure safe distance)
3. **Desired Speed:** 5.5 m/s (slightly lower than historical average for safety)
4. **Desired Headway:** 2.6 s (maintaining historical average for safety)

### Summary:
- **N:** 10
- **Q:** 1
- **R:** 2.0
- **Q_h:** 3.5
- **Desired Speed:** 5.5 m/s
- **Desired Headway:** 2.6 s

These parameters should provide a balance between maintaining a safe distance from the preceding vehicle, ensuring smooth control, and achieving a reasonable speed given the current road conditions.
Sure, here are the optimized MPC parameters in the requested list format:

\[10, 1, 2.0, 3.5, 5.5, 2.6\]
