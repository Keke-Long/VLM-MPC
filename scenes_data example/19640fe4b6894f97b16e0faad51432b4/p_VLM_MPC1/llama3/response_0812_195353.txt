It seems like you're providing some environmental information. Let me summarize it for you:

* Weather: Rainy
* Lighting: Night
* Road Type: Highway

Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss or ask about this environment? I'm here to help!
Thank you for summarizing the environmental information. Based on the provided reasoning steps, I will generate the MPC parameters.

**Step 1: Understand the Current Situation**

The current situation is a rainy night with parked vehicles on the roadside. The ego vehicle is moving at a moderate speed (around 4-5 m/s) and has a preceding vehicle ahead. The goal is to maintain a safe distance while minimizing control effort.

**Step 2: Evaluate the Prediction Horizon (N)**

Considering the scenario, I will set N = 9, which is based on historical data for this specific scenario (rain, intersection, parking_lot).

**Step 3: Set Cost Weights**

* Q is fixed at 1 to simplify the optimization process.
* Balance R and Q_h relative to Q:
	+ Control effort weight (R) should be higher than headway maintenance weight (Q_h) to prioritize maintaining a safe distance. A reasonable balance could be R = 2-3 times Q_h.
	+ Set Q_h = 1.5 (based on the desired headway of 2.6 seconds and the relative speed of the preceding vehicle).

**Step 4: Define Desired Speed**

The desired speed should be safe and efficient. Considering the scenario, I will set the desired speed to a moderate value that balances safety and efficiency. A reasonable value could be desired_speed = 7 m/s.

**Step 5: Determine Desired Headway**

The desired headway should ensure a safe distance to the preceding vehicle. Based on the relative position and speed of the preceding vehicle, I will set the desired headway to a value that is slightly larger than the current headway (20.72 meters). A reasonable value could be desired_headway = 3 seconds.

**MPC Parameters**

Based on the above reasoning, the MPC parameters are:

[N, Q, R, Q_h, desired_speed, desired_headway] = [9, 1, 2.25, 1.5, 7, 3]

These parameters will be used for the short term and may need to be updated in the next 20 seconds when the scene information is updated again.
