It seems like you're providing some environmental information. Let me summarize it for you:

* Weather: Rainy
* Lighting: Night
* Road Type: Highway

Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss or ask about this environment? I'm here to help!
Thank you for summarizing the environmental information. Based on the provided scenario and reasoning steps, I will generate the MPC parameters.

**Step 1: Understand the Current Situation**

The ego vehicle is currently traveling on a highway at night in rainy conditions with parked vehicles on the roadside. The preceding vehicle is detected to be approximately 20.72 meters ahead along the direction of travel, with a relative speed of 4.89 m/s and acceleration of 0.34 m/s².

**Step 2: Evaluate the Prediction Horizon (N)**

Considering the scenario, I recommend setting N = 10, as this will allow the controller to look ahead far enough to anticipate potential changes in the preceding vehicle's behavior or road conditions while still being responsive to immediate needs.

**Step 3: Set Cost Weights**

To simplify the optimization process and prioritize safety, I set Q = 1. For control effort weight R, I balance it with headway maintenance weight Q_h to ensure a safe distance from the preceding vehicle. A reasonable choice would be R ≈ 0.5 and Q_h ≈ 2.

**Step 4: Define Desired Speed**

Considering the rainy conditions and parked vehicles on the roadside, I recommend setting desired_speed = 7 m/s, which is a moderate speed that balances safety with efficiency.

**Step 5: Determine Desired Headway**

To ensure a safe distance from the preceding vehicle, I set desired_headway = 2.5 seconds, which corresponds to approximately 23 meters along the direction of travel (based on the relative position and speed of the preceding vehicle).

Here are the generated MPC parameters:

[N, Q, R, Q_h, desired_speed, desired_headway] = [10, 1, 0.5, 2, 7, 2.5]

Please note that these parameters should be considered for the short term and may need to be updated when new scene information is provided in the next 20 seconds.
