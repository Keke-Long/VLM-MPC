### Step 1: Current Situation Understanding
- **Weather:** Rainy
- **Lighting:** Night
- **Road Type:** Highway
- **Static Obstacles:** Parked vehicles on the roadside
- **Ego Vehicle State:** Decelerating with varying acceleration

### Step 2: Evaluation of Prediction Horizon (N)
- **Preferred Prediction Horizon:** 10 (default)
- **Recommendation:** Keep N at 10 for a reasonable lookahead considering the highway scenario.

### Step 3: Setting Cost Weights
- **Q (Speed Maintenance Weight):** 1 (fixed)
- **R (Control Effort Weight):** 1.93 (historical average)
- **Q_h (Headway Maintenance Weight):** 3.11 (historical average)
- **Recommendation:** Maintain the historical average weights for R and Q_h to balance control effort and headway maintenance.

### Step 4: Desired Speed
- **Desired Speed Range:** 5 to 11 m/s
- **Historical Average Desired Speed:** 6.21 m/s
- **Recommendation:** Set the desired speed to the historical average of 6.21 m/s for a balance of safety and efficiency.

### Step 5: Desired Headway
- **Historical Average Desired Headway:** 2.6 s
- **Recommendation:** Maintain the desired headway at 2.6 seconds to ensure a safe distance to the preceding vehicle.

### Final MPC Parameters:
1. **Prediction Horizon (N):** 10
2. **Cost Weights:**
   - Q (Speed Maintenance Weight): 1
   - R (Control Effort Weight): 1.93
   - Q_h (Headway Maintenance Weight): 3.11
3. **Desired Speed:** 6.21 m/s
4. **Desired Headway:** 2.6 seconds

These optimized MPC parameters aim to balance speed maintenance, control effort, and headway maintenance for safe and efficient autonomous driving in the current rainy, night-time highway scenario with parked vehicles as static obstacles.
The optimized MPC parameters in the requested list format are as follows:
- [10, 1, 1.93, 3.11, 6.21, 2.6]
