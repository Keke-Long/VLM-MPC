### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Current Situation**:
   - **Environment**: Clear weather, daytime, commercial area road with parked vehicles.
   - **Ego Vehicle State**: 
     - Position: (1233.49, 1366.83)
     - Speed: 1.89 m/s
     - Acceleration: 1.50 m/s²
     - Direction: 0.00 radians
   - **Surrounding Vehicles**:
     - Preceding vehicle at a relative position of (-0.02, 13.77) with a relative speed of 1.83 m/s and relative acceleration of 0.01 m/s².

2. **Evaluate the Prediction Horizon (N)**:
   - Given the current speed (1.89 m/s) and the commercial area with potential for frequent stops and starts, a prediction horizon of 10 time steps is reasonable to balance responsiveness and computational load.

3. **Set Cost Weights**:
   - **Q (speed maintenance weight)**: Fixed at 1.
   - **R (control effort weight)**: Given the need for smooth control in a commercial area with potential obstacles, a moderate value of 1.93 is appropriate.
   - **Q_h (headway maintenance weight)**: To ensure safety and maintain a comfortable distance from the preceding vehicle, a value of 3.11 is suitable.

4. **Define Desired Speed**:
   - Considering the commercial area and the current speed of 1.89 m/s, a desired speed of 6.21 m/s is reasonable to ensure safe and efficient travel without exceeding typical speed limits for such areas.

5. **Determine Desired Headway**:
   - Given the current relative speed and the need for safety, a desired headway of 2.6 seconds is appropriate to maintain a safe distance from the preceding vehicle.

### Optimized MPC Parameters:

1. **Prediction Horizon (N)**: 10
2. **Cost Weights**:
   - **Q (speed maintenance weight)**: 1
   - **R (control effort weight)**: 1.93
   - **Q_h (headway maintenance weight)**: 3.11
3. **desired_speed**: 6.21 m/s
4. **desired_headway**: 2.6 s

These parameters should provide a balance between maintaining a safe distance from the preceding vehicle, achieving a reasonable speed for the environment, and ensuring smooth control efforts.
Sure, here are the MPC parameters in the requested list format:

\[10, 1, 1.93, 3.11, 6.21, 2.6\]
