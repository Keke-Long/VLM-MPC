### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Current Situation:**
   - **Weather:** Clear
   - **Lighting:** Daytime
   - **Road Type:** Road with parked vehicles on the roadside
   - **Ego Vehicle State:** The vehicle is decelerating and moving slowly.
   - **Surrounding Vehicles:** There is a preceding vehicle 15.65 meters ahead, moving slightly faster than the ego vehicle.

2. **Evaluate the Prediction Horizon (N):**
   - The preferred value is 10, which is reasonable for the current scenario to predict the vehicle's behavior over a short-term horizon.

3. **Set Cost Weights:**
   - **Q (speed maintenance weight):** Fixed at 1.
   - **R (control effort weight):** Needs to balance the control effort to avoid aggressive maneuvers. Given the current slow speed and the need for smooth driving, a moderate value is appropriate.
   - **Q_h (headway maintenance weight):** Needs to ensure a safe distance from the preceding vehicle. Given the current slow speed and the presence of parked vehicles, a higher value is appropriate to prioritize safety.

4. **Define Desired Speed:**
   - The target speed should be safe and efficient. Given the current slow speed and the presence of obstacles, a moderate desired speed is appropriate.

5. **Determine Desired Headway:**
   - The desired headway should ensure a safe distance from the preceding vehicle. Given the current slow speed and the presence of obstacles, a slightly higher headway is appropriate.

### Optimized MPC Parameters:

1. **Prediction Horizon (N):** 10
2. **Cost Weights:**
   - **Q (speed maintenance weight):** 1 (fixed)
   - **R (control effort weight):** 2.0 (to ensure smooth control efforts)
   - **Q_h (headway maintenance weight):** 3.5 (to prioritize maintaining a safe distance)
3. **Desired Speed:** 5.5 m/s (to ensure safe and efficient driving)
4. **Desired Headway:** 3.0 s (to ensure a safe distance from the preceding vehicle)

### Summary:
- **N:** 10
- **Q:** 1
- **R:** 2.0
- **Q_h:** 3.5
- **Desired Speed:** 5.5 m/s
- **Desired Headway:** 3.0 s

These parameters should be suitable for the current scenario, ensuring safe and efficient driving while maintaining a safe distance from the preceding vehicle.
Sure, here are the MPC parameters in the requested list format:
