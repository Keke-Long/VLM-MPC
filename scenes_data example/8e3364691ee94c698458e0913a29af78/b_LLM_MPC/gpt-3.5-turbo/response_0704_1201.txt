Based on the current situation and step-by-step reasoning provided, let's generate the optimal MPC parameters:

1. **Understand the Current Situation**:
   - The weather is clear, it's daytime, and the road is a commercial area road with parked vehicles.
   - Ego vehicle is moving at a speed of 1.89 m/s with an acceleration of 1.50 m/sÂ².
   - One preceding vehicle is detected with specific relative state information.

2. **Evaluate the Prediction Horizon (N)**:
   - Considering the ego vehicle's speed and the need for responsive control in a commercial area, a prediction horizon of 10 time steps (N=10) is reasonable.

3. **Set Cost Weights**:
   - Q (speed maintenance weight): 1
   - R (control effort weight): 0.5 (Balanced weight for minimizing control effort)
   - Q_h (headway maintenance weight): 0.8 (Weight for maintaining the desired headway)

4. **Define Desired Speed**:
   - The desired speed for the ego vehicle can be set at 7 m/s for a balance between safety and efficiency in a commercial area.

5. **Determine Desired Headway**:
   - Considering the relative position, speed, and acceleration of the preceding vehicle, a desired headway of 2 seconds can be maintained for safety.

Therefore, the optimal MPC parameters are as follows:

[MPC Parameters]
- Prediction Horizon (N): 10
- Cost Weights:
  - Q (speed maintenance weight): 1
  - R (control effort weight): 0.5
  - Q_h (headway maintenance weight): 0.8
- Desired Speed: 7 m/s
- Desired Headway: 2 seconds

These parameters aim to optimize the control strategy for the ego vehicle in the current driving scenario.
