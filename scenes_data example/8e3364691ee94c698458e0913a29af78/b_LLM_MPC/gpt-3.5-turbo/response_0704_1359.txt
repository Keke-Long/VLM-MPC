Based on the current situation and step-by-step reasoning provided, let's generate the optimal MPC parameters:

1. **Prediction Horizon (N):** Since the ego vehicle is moving at a low speed and considering the environment, a prediction horizon of 10 time steps seems reasonable.

2. **Cost Weights:**
   - **Q (speed maintenance weight):** Fixed at 1.
   - **R (control effort weight):** To balance safety and control effort, let's set R = 0.5.
   - **Q_h (headway maintenance weight):** Considering the importance of maintaining a safe headway, let's set Q_h = 2.

3. **Desired Speed:** Given the current speed and environment, a desired speed of 6 m/s seems appropriate for safety and efficiency.

4. **Desired Headway:** Considering the relative speed and acceleration of the preceding vehicle, maintaining a headway of 1 second (desired_headway = 1) would be safe.

Therefore, the optimal MPC parameters are:

[MPC Parameters]
- **Prediction Horizon (N):** 10
- **Cost Weights:**
  - Q = 1
  - R = 0.5
  - Q_h = 2
- **Desired Speed:** 6 m/s
- **Desired Headway:** 1 second

These parameters are optimized to ensure safe and efficient autonomous driving considering the current environment and vehicle states.
The optimal MPC parameters in the requested list format are:
