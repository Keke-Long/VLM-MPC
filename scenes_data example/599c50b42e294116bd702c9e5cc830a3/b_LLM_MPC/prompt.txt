Current Environment:
Weather: rainy
Lighting: Dusk
Road Type: road
Static Obstacles: There are parked vehicles on the roadside

Ego Vehicle State (last 5 seconds to present):
Position (x, y): [(782.02, 2591.91), (784.05, 2587.53), (785.67, 2583.82), (787.14, 2580.19), (788.45, 2576.53)]
Speed (m/s): [9.66, 8.09, 7.83, 7.77, 7.63]
Acceleration (m/s²): [3.00, 0.67, 0.65, 0.81, 1.88]
    
Surrounding Vehicles State (current moment):
One vehicle is detected as the preceding vehicle:
- Relative Position (delta_x, delta_y): (-0.72, 54.03) Note: delta_y is the distance along the direction of the ego vehicle's travel, and delta_x is the distance perpendicular to the ego vehicle's travel direction.
- Relative Speed (m/s): 7.66
- Relative Acceleration (m/s²): 2.22
        
Average Parameters Based on Historical Data:
According to historical data, the average parameters in the current scenario (rain, intersection, parking_lot) are as follows:
- N: 9
- Q: 1
- Q_h: 3.11
- R: 1.93
- desired_speed: 6.21
- desired_headway: 2.6
    

The MPC parameters to be optimized include:
1. Prediction Horizon (N): The number of time steps the controller looks ahead. (Preferred value: 10)
2. Cost Weights:
   - Q (speed maintenance weight): Fixed at 1.
   - R (control effort weight): Weight for minimizing control effort.
   - Q_h (headway maintenance weight): Weight for maintaining the desired headway (distance) to the front vehicle.
3. desired_speed: The target speed (m/s) for the ego vehicle. (Range: 5 to 11 m/s)
4. desired_headway: The desired headway (s) between the ego vehicle and the front vehicle.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Understand the Current Situation.
2. Evaluate the Prediction Horizon (N).
3. Set Cost Weights:
   - Q is fixed at 1 to simplify the optimization process.
   - Balance R (control effort weight) and Q_h (headway maintenance weight) relative to Q, considering safety and comfort.
4. Define Desired Speed that is safe and efficient .
5. Determine Desired Headway to ensure a safe distance to the preceding vehicle.

Now, apply this reasoning to generate the MPC parameters.
