Given the current environment and the state of the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles, let's optimize the MPC parameters for the short term.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Current Situation**:
   - **Weather**: Cloudy
   - **Lighting**: Daytime
   - **Road Type**: Commercial area road
   - **Static Obstacles**: Truck ahead
   - **Ego Vehicle State**:
     - Position: (1352.41, 1007.12)
     - Speed: 6.93 m/s
     - Acceleration: 1.88 m/s²
     - Direction: 0.00 radians
   - **Surrounding Vehicles State**:
     - Preceding vehicle:
       - Relative Position: (-0.3, 46.07)
       - Relative Speed: 0.04 m/s
       - Relative Acceleration: 0.01 m/s²

2. **Evaluate the Prediction Horizon (N)**:
   - The preferred value is 10, which is reasonable given the current speed and the need to react to the truck ahead.

3. **Set Cost Weights**:
   - **Q (speed maintenance weight)**: Fixed at 1.
   - **R (control effort weight)**: Given the need for smooth control in a commercial area, a moderate value is appropriate.
   - **Q_h (headway maintenance weight)**: Given the truck ahead, maintaining a safe headway is crucial, so a higher value is appropriate.

4. **Define Desired Speed**:
   - The current speed is 6.93 m/s, which is slightly above the average desired speed of 6.21 m/s. Given the truck ahead and the commercial area, a slightly lower desired speed is safer.

5. **Determine Desired Headway**:
   - The average desired headway is 2.6 seconds. Given the truck ahead and the need for safety, maintaining this headway is appropriate.

### Optimized MPC Parameters:

1. **Prediction Horizon (N)**: 10
2. **Cost Weights**:
   - **Q (speed maintenance weight)**: 1 (fixed)
   - **R (control effort weight)**: 2.0 (moderate to ensure smooth control)
   - **Q_h (headway maintenance weight)**: 3.5 (higher to prioritize safety)
3. **desired_speed**: 6.0 m/s (slightly lower for safety in a commercial area)
4. **desired_headway**: 2.6 s (maintaining the average desired headway for safety)

### Summary:
- **N**: 10
- **Q**: 1
- **R**: 2.0
- **Q_h**: 3.5
- **desired_speed**: 6.0 m/s
- **desired_headway**: 2.6 s

These parameters should provide a balance between maintaining a safe distance from the truck ahead, ensuring smooth control, and maintaining an appropriate speed for the commercial area.
Sure, here are the optimized MPC parameters in the requested list format:

\[10, 1, 2.0, 3.5, 6.0, 2.6\]
