Based on the current situation and historical data, let's optimize the MPC parameters step by step:

1. **Current Situation Analysis**:
   - Weather: Cloudy
   - Lighting: Daytime
   - Road Type: Road
   - Static Obstacles: Truck ahead
   - Ego Vehicle State: Decelerating with varying acceleration and speed
   - Surrounding Vehicles: One preceding vehicle detected with small relative speed and acceleration

2. **Evaluation of Prediction Horizon (N)**:
   - Preferred value: 10
   - Given average N from historical data: 9
   - Recommendation: Increase N to 10 for better prediction and control.

3. **Cost Weights**:
   - Q (speed maintenance weight): Fixed at 1
   - R (control effort weight): 1.93 (average from historical data)
   - Q_h (headway maintenance weight): 3.11 (average from historical data)
   - Recommendation: Keep Q as 1, set R = 2 and Q_h = 3 for a balanced optimization considering safety and comfort.

4. **Desired Speed**:
   - Range: 5 to 11 m/s
   - Average desired_speed from historical data: 6.21 m/s
   - Recommendation: Maintain desired_speed at 6.21 m/s for a safe and efficient speed.

5. **Desired Headway**:
   - Average desired_headway from historical data: 2.6 s
   - Recommendation: Maintain desired_headway at 2.6 s to ensure a safe distance to the preceding vehicle.

Therefore, the optimized MPC parameters are:
- Prediction Horizon (N): 10
- Cost Weights: Q = 1, R = 2, Q_h = 3
- Desired Speed: 6.21 m/s
- Desired Headway: 2.6 s

These parameters aim to enhance the control strategy for the ego vehicle in the current scenario with a preceding truck and ensure safe and efficient autonomous driving.
The optimized MPC parameters in the requested list format are:
- [10, 1, 2, 3, 6.21, 2.6]
