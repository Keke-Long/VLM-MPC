Based on the current situation and step-by-step reasoning, let's generate the optimal MPC parameters:

1. **Prediction Horizon (N):** Since the ego vehicle is currently traveling at a speed of 6.93 m/s in a commercial area with a truck ahead, a prediction horizon of 10 time steps seems reasonable to anticipate potential changes in the environment and surrounding vehicles.

2. **Cost Weights:**
   - **Q (speed maintenance weight):** Fixed at 1.
   - **R (control effort weight):** Given the presence of a truck ahead and the need for smooth control, a value of 0.5 is chosen to balance control effort with speed maintenance.
   - **Q_h (headway maintenance weight):** Considering the importance of maintaining a safe headway to the front vehicle, a value of 2 is selected to prioritize headway maintenance.

3. **Desired Speed:** Considering the current speed of 6.93 m/s and the commercial area road conditions, a desired speed of 8 m/s is chosen to ensure a balance between safety and efficiency.

4. **Desired Headway:** The desired headway is calculated based on the relative position and speed of the preceding vehicle. Given the relative speed of 0.04 m/s and the current headway of 46.07 meters, a desired headway of 2 seconds is selected to maintain a safe distance to the front vehicle.

Therefore, the optimal MPC parameters are as follows:

[MPC Parameters]
- **Prediction Horizon (N):** 10
- **Q (speed maintenance weight):** 1
- **R (control effort weight):** 0.5
- **Q_h (headway maintenance weight):** 2
- **Desired Speed:** 8 m/s
- **Desired Headway:** 2 seconds

These parameters are optimized to ensure safe and efficient autonomous driving in the current environment and traffic conditions.
