Based on the current situation and step-by-step reasoning, let's generate the optimal MPC parameters:

1. **Understand the Current Situation**:
   - Weather: Cloudy
   - Lighting: Daytime
   - Road Type: Commercial area road
   - Static Obstacles: Truck ahead
   - Ego Vehicle State:
     - Position (x, y): (1352.41, 1007.12)
     - Speed: 6.93 m/s
     - Acceleration: 1.88 m/s²
     - Direction: 0.00 radians
   - Surrounding Vehicles State:
     - Preceding Vehicle:
       - Relative Position (delta_x, delta_y): (-0.3, 46.07)
       - Relative Speed: 0.04 m/s
       - Relative Acceleration: 0.01 m/s²

2. **Evaluate the Prediction Horizon (N)**:
   - Considering the current speed and environment, a prediction horizon of 10 time steps seems reasonable.

3. **Set Cost Weights**:
   - Q (speed maintenance weight): 1
   - R (control effort weight): 0.5 (balanced with safety and comfort)
   - Q_h (headway maintenance weight): 0.8 (balanced with safety and comfort)

4. **Define Desired Speed**:
   - Target speed (desired_speed): 8 m/s (safe and efficient for the current conditions)

5. **Determine Desired Headway**:
   - Desired headway: 2 seconds (ensuring a safe distance to the preceding vehicle)

Therefore, the optimal MPC parameters are:
[N, Q, R, Q_h, desired_speed, desired_headway] = [10, 1, 0.5, 0.8, 8, 2]
The optimal MPC parameters in the requested list format are: 
[10, 1, 0.5, 0.8, 8, 2]
